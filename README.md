# Very simple HTML boilerplate
This is a simple template I use each time I need to do some quick&diry test with web pages.

Basically it includes [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), all using a CDN and not a local version, so consider pro&cons.

It has two declared sections for in-page CSS and Javascript.
